        <h4> about me </h4>
        <p> as you likely gathered from the index page, or maybe even the website title, my name is tyler.</p>
        <p> i am an 18 year old based in brisbane, australia. </p>
        <p> i'm nonbinary, and my pronouns are they / them </p>
        <p> a lot of my time is spent either on my hobbies, or sleeping. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="contentbox">
        <h4> my hobbies </h4>
        <p> seeing as i have a website you can probably guess i enjoy using computers. </p>
        <p> specifically, i enjoy cybersecurity and network engineering. </p>
        <p> i also enjoy playing keyboard and bass guitar. </p>
        <p> most of the music i play, and listen to, is jazz or funk (or some closely related genre like jazz fusion, acid jazz, etc.) </p>
        <p> however, i play in a punk(?) / grunge(?) band. funny how that works. </p>
        <p> shameless plug, the band is called <a href="https://drizzledawg.com">drizzle dawg </a>. </p>
        <p> those are the only 2 interesting things i do. </p>
