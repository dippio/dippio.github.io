        <h4> (attempting to) repair my x201  (WIP ARTICLE, YOU SHOULDN'T SEE THIS) </h4>
        <p> i recently picked up my dream laptop, the lenovo x201, for a decent price.</p>
        <p> now, why was a laptop from 2009 my dream laptop? </p>
        <p> the tiny form factor and the keyboard are my main 2 reasons.  </p>
        <div class="teenyTinyText"> 
            <p> (theres a third reason but it's just that im a faggot and all faggot linux users have some sort of thinkpad) </p>
        </div>
        <p> i'd been trying to get my hands on one for ages, so i impulse bought it after seeing one for so cheap </p>
        <p> ... <br> ... <br> ... </p>
        <p> i broke it less than a week after buying it </p>
        <p> accidently knocked it off my bed onto carpet and it still completely died. </p>
    </div>
    

    <div class="contentbox">
        <h4> what to do? </h4>
        <p> now obviously i wasn't gonna just leave it as a paperweight</p>
        <p> first order of business was to reseat the ram and reset the cmos battery </p>
        <p> doing that lead to nothing, so i tried disconnecting the ram entirely</p>
        <p> and upon turning it on, there was no beep code to indicate the ram was disconnected </p>
        <p> <i> uh oh </i> </p>
        <p> <i> thats not good </i> </p>
        <p> <i> like, very not good </i> </p>
        <p> i tried disconnecting the trackpad and keyboard, the wifi module, anything i could easily disconnect. </p>
        <p> plugged the power adapter back in and....</p>
        <p> still nothing. </p>
        <p> if i wasn't already worried before, i was freaking the fuck out by this point. </p>
