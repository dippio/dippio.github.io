        <h4> (attempting to) repair my x201 </h4>
        <p> i recently picked up my dream laptop, the lenovo x201, for a decent price.</p>
        <div class="teenyTinyText"> 
            <p> admittedly its not really what id consider my dream laptop anymore after having to deal with the built-in intel spyware and overheating issues, but alas </p>
        </div>
        <p> but i needed a laptop for my classes, and after seeing one for a reasonable price, i decided why not.</p>
        <p> i broke it less than a week after buying it lol </p>
        <p> accidently knocked it off my bed onto carpet and it still completely died. </p>
        <p> turns out thinkpads aren't as indestructable as people make them out to be. </p>
    </div>
    

    <div class="contentbox">
        <h4> what to do? </h4>
        <p> now obviously i wasn't gonna just leave it as a paperweight</p>
        <p> first order of business was to reseat the ram and reset the cmos battery </p>
        <p> doing that lead to nothing, so i tried disconnecting the ram entirely</p>
        <p> and upon turning it on, there was no beep code to indicate the ram was disconnected </p>
        <p> <i> uh oh </i> </p>
        <p> <i> thats not good </i> </p>
        <p> <i> like, very not good </i> </p>
        <p> i tried disconnecting the trackpad and keyboard, the wifi module, anything i could easily disconnect. </p>
        <p> plugged the power adapter back in and....</p>
        <p> still nothing. </p>
        <p> luckily, my partner was around to give me cuddles and calm me down so i didn't freak the fuck out over my 60 dollar paperweight. </p>
        <p> and so i left it and kinda just forgot about it. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="contentbox">
        <h4> trying again </h4>
        <p> a few weeks had paassed since i first broke the laptop </p>
        <p> i hadn't really touched it since a day or two after i broke it, and i was just fed up with looking at the husk of a laptop sitting on my desk. </p>
        <div class="postImage">

            <div class="teenyTinyText">
                <p> it was incredibly depressing having to look at my dream laptop in this state every single day</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p> so i decided to try again and fix it. </p>
        <p> first order of business, starting from square 1 and trying to rediagnose everything. </p>
        <p> i disconnected the ram, wifi module, trackpad, everything i tried before </p>
        <p> lo and behold, it started beeping. </p>
        <p> specifically, 1 3 3 1. </p>
        <p> i immediately knew this was a ram issue, given i had to help a friend with his laptop making the same beep code a few years prior </p>
        <p> so of course, i got overly excited, reinstalled the ram modules, and... </p>
        <p> back to nothing. </p>
        <p> however, disconnecting the ram again did cause it to do the beep code again, which gave me hope </p>
        <p> then it occured to me, i never actually tried checking every ram module in every slot, meaning i could have just had bad luck and managed to accidently kill a ram stick or a ram slot. </p>
        <p> so i tried switching the right module into the left slot, and it suddenly started working. </p>
        <p> it's unfortunate that one of the ram slots is kinda just dead, but it is what it is.</p>
        <p> it's always the simplest and most obvious solution lol</p>
    </div>

    <div class="contentbox">
        <h4> conclusions  </h4>
        <p> if you break something, pretend it never existed and it will magically be fine again </p>
    </div>
